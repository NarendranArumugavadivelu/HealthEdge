With the provided input
  -- [3,7,8,3,6,1]
  To get the number of buildings 3 with [8,6,1] as remaining buildings have an obstructions with buildings to the right of the array, I was able to traverse the array from backwards.
  
In case to traverse the array from front, the result would be same 3 buildings [3,7,8] as remaining buildings have an obstructions to the left of the array.
